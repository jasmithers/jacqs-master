<p><strong>Family portraits</strong>

Family portraits are always great to have, as it helps remind you of the great memories you share together. I enjoy capturing those funny moments during a photo shoot. To be honest to many people photo sessions can be awkward at first but there are always ways to make it fun so I can photograph that natural smile and laughter.  For pricing and details on what you will receive, please hit the request a quote button up top! ^^

<strong>Engagement Sessions</strong>

<p>
  I recommend to any engaged couple to get engagement photos done up with the photographer you book for your wedding or even another photographer. If you are not comfortable being photographed, this session will give you practice on your posing skills and if it is with the same photographer as your wedding you will know how they work before the big day!

With my session, if you book your wedding with me the Engagement Session is included! These sessions start at $100.00 for 15-20 photos and then the $100 is deducted from the quoted wedding package. You also have the option to get two Save the Date Designs with your photos, which comes with the Engagement Session.

<strong>New Born</strong>

<p>I am new to photographing babies however I have very gentile hand and I will be as delicate as possible when it comes to posing your new-born.  I will bring props in which I will use to create a relaxed and comfy scene for your baby. You can either come to my mini home studio or I can come to your home in the HRM area. You will get more then one pose and 15-20 photos! We can also do different holiday scenes if you wish to get them done early. Photo packages start at $230.00, please hit the request a quote button for detailed information!

<strong>Maternity</strong>
<p>
I have done a few maternity shoots in the past and believe that this experience will contribute to new clients. I will make you feel comfortable and try not to do any poses that make you feel awkward.  Feel free to send me ideas that you have for poses and themes.  I can do in studio or on location in HRM. Please contact me for more details on pricing.
